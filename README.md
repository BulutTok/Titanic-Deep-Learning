# Titanic Survival Prediction Using Deep Learning

## Overview
This GitHub repository is dedicated to predicting the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using deep learning techniques. The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras, analyzing features such as age, sex, and passenger class to determine survival outcomes.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- TensorFlow

### Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/BulutToke/titanic-deep-learning.git
cd titanic-deep-learning

###Install the required Python libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn tensorflow
Fetch the Data
Data is automatically downloaded when you run the Jupyter notebook included in the repository.

### Usage
Execute the Jupyter Notebook Titanic_Deep_Learning.ipynb to go through the data preprocessing, model building, and training processes. The notebook provides a comprehensive guide from start to finish.

### Model Architecture
### The model includes:

### Input layer
Multiple hidden layers with 100 neurons each, using ReLU activation
Output layer with sigmoid activation
The model uses the Adam optimizer and binary crossentropy loss
